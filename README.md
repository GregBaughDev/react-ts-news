# News App

'News App' is a web application built with React and TypeScript. The app utilises the Guardian API to retrieve news stories and search topics.  
   
I built the app so I could put my Typescript learning into practice. I quickly picked up syntax and logic behind Typescript but implementing it within a React project was fairly challenging. I learnt a lot during the development of this app, including how to use TS with hooks (state and ref), props and functions.
